/** \brief The QDjangoModel class is the base class for all models.
 *
 *  To declare your own model, create a class which inherits QDjangoModel
 *  and declare the database fields as properties using the Q_PROPERTY
 *  macro.
 *
 *  You can provide additional information about a field using the Q_CLASSINFO
 *  macro, in the form:
 *
 *  \code
 *  Q_PROPERTY("field_name", "keyword1=value1 .. keywordN=valueN")
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  The following keywords are recognised:
 *
 *  \li \c auto_increment if set to 'true', and if this field is the primary
 *  key, it will be marked as auto-increment.
 *  \li \c db_index if set to 'true', an index will be created on this field.
 *  \li \c ignore_field if set to 'true', this field will be ignored
 *  \li \c max_length the maximum length of the field (used when creating
 *  the database table)
 *  \li \c primary_key if set to 'true', this field will be used as the primary
 *  key. If no primary key is explicitly defined, an auto-increment integer
 *  field will be added.
 *
 *  You must then register the class with QDjango using QDjango::registerModel().
